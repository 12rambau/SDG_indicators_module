This module allows to generate data for reporting on SDG indicators. The SEPAL SDG indicator module follows SDG best practice guidance, such as the [best practice guidance from UNCCD on SDG 15.3.1.](https://prais.unccd.int/sites/default/files/helper_documents/4-GPG_15.3.1_EN.pdf) The methodology for SDG 15.3.1 was implemented in consultation with the trends.earth team at Conservation International.

If you have any question or encounter any bugs, post the issue on the [bug report page](https://github.com/12rambau/sdg_indicators_module/issues/new).
